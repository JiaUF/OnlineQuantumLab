# Interactive Quantum Computing Modules for Undergraduate Education

Interactive Quantum Computing Modules for Undergraduate Education This repository hosts a collection of project-based learning modules designed to introduce undergraduate students to key concepts and hands-on experiences in quantum computing. 

This repository hosts a curated collection of hands-on, project-based learning modules designed to introduce undergraduate and advanced pre-collegiate students to quantum computing. Developed and piloted at the University of Florida, the curriculum leverages **Jupyter notebooks** and **Qiskit** to support interactive coding, visualization, and exploration—requiring only basic linear algebra and introductory Python programming.

## Background and Vision

Launched in Spring 2023 and expanded in a 2025 summer pilot program, this initiative combines **flipped classroom**, **gamified learning**, and **project-based learning (PBL)** strategies to make quantum computing accessible and engaging across diverse STEM backgrounds. The program has successfully included high school students and university faculty with no prior quantum experience.

## Flagship Projects (Piloted)

- **Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe**  
  Explore quantum superposition, entanglement, and measurement through gameplay. No prior background required.

- **Bloch Sphere & Quantum Gate Simulator**  
  Visualize and manipulate qubit states and quantum gates. Built using Qiskit, with interactive coding in Jupyter.

- **BB84 Quantum Cryptography**  
  Implement quantum key distribution and understand quantum-safe communication protocols.

## Upcoming Modules (In Development)

- **Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm**  
  Learn quantum speedup through one of the earliest quantum algorithms.

- **Hydrogen Molecule Solver (VQE & QAOA)**  
  Use variational quantum algorithms to find molecular ground-state energies.

- **Quantum Linear Systems & QML**  
  Explore the HHL algorithm and its applications in quantum machine learning.
