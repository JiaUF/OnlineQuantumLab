# Online Quantum Computing Lab
This repository hosts a curated collection of hands-on, project-based learning modules designed to introduce undergraduate students, advanced pre-collegiate learners, and individuals new to quantum computing—without prior experience in quantum mechanics—to its core concepts. Developed and piloted at the University of Florida, the curriculum leverages Jupyter notebooks and Qiskit to enable interactive coding, visualization, and exploration, requiring only basic linear algebra and introductory Python programming.

## Background and Vision

Launched in Spring 2023 and expanded in a 2025 summer pilot program, this initiative combines **flipped classroom**, **gamified learning**, and **project-based learning (PBL)** strategies to make quantum computing accessible and engaging across diverse STEM backgrounds. The program has successfully included high school students and university faculty with no prior quantum experience.

## Flagship Projects (Piloted)

- **Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe**  
  Explore quantum superposition, entanglement, and measurement through gameplay. No prior background required.

- [**Bloch Sphere & Quantum Gate Simulator**](QuantumGateVisualization.ipynb) 
  Visualize and manipulate qubit states and quantum gates. Built using Qiskit, with interactive coding in Jupyter.

- **BB84 Quantum Cryptography**  
  Implement quantum key distribution and understand quantum-safe communication protocols.

## Upcoming Modules (In Development)

- **Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm**  
  Learn quantum speedup through one of the earliest quantum algorithms.

- **Hydrogen Molecule Solver (VQE & QAOA)**  
  Use variational quantum algorithms to find molecular ground-state energies.

- **Quantum Algorithms for Linear Systems & Quantum Machine Learning**  
  Explore the HHL algorithm and its applications in quantum machine learning.
